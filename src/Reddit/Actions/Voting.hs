-- | Contains actions for voting on posts and comments. There are functions
--   for upvoting ('upvotePost', 'upvoteComment'), downvoting ('downvotePost',
--   'downVoteComment') as well as removing votes that have already been cast
--   ('unvotePost', 'unvoteComment').
--
--   Please note that automated voting (i.e. by a bot, as opposed to being
--   specifically ordered to by a person) is strictly against the Reddit rules,
--   and is a very effective way of getting your bot shadowbanned.
